% ISINT returns true if all values of X are integers, but class can be arbitrary
% numerical array
% 
% Inputs: 
%   **x - checked array 
%  *optional*
%   **prec - precision threshold used to decide whether the number is still integer, default = 0.01
% *returns*: 
%  is_integer - scalar bool
