% Introduction 
% •	This license agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which the PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUT (PSI), CH-5232 Villigen-PSI, Switzerland (hereafter "LICENSOR") 
%   will grant you (hereafter "LICENSEE") a royalty-free, non-exclusive license for academic, non-commercial purposes only (hereafter "LICENSE") to use the cSAXS 
%   ptychography MATLAB package computer software program and associated documentation furnished hereunder (hereafter "PROGRAM").
%
% Terms and Conditions of the LICENSE
% 1.	LICENSOR grants to LICENSEE a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the PROGRAM for academic, non-commercial purposes, upon the terms and conditions 
%       hereinafter set out and until termination of this license as set forth below.
% 2.	LICENSEE acknowledges that the PROGRAM is a research tool still in the development stage. The PROGRAM is provided without any related services, improvements 
%       or warranties from LICENSOR and that the LICENSE is entered into in order to enable others to utilize the PROGRAM in their academic activities. It is the 
%       LICENSEE’s responsibility to ensure its proper use and the correctness of the results.”
% 3.	THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR 
%       A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR, THE AUTHORS OR THE COPYRIGHT 
%       HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE 
%       OF THE PROGRAM OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.
% 4.	LICENSEE agrees that it will use the PROGRAM and any modifications, improvements, or derivatives of PROGRAM that LICENSEE may create (collectively, 
%       "IMPROVEMENTS") solely for academic, non-commercial purposes and that any copy of PROGRAM or derivatives thereof shall be distributed only under the same 
%       license as PROGRAM. The terms "academic, non-commercial", as used in this Agreement, mean academic or other scholarly research which (a) is not undertaken for 
%       profit, or (b) is not intended to produce works, services, or data for commercial use, or (c) is neither conducted, nor funded, by a person or an entity engaged 
%       in the commercial use, application or exploitation of works similar to the PROGRAM.
% 5.	LICENSEE agrees that it shall make the following acknowledgement in any publication resulting from the use of the PROGRAM or any translation of the code into 
%       another computing language:
%       "Data processing was carried out using the cSAXS ptychography MATLAB package developed by the Science IT and the coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) groups, Paul 
%       Scherrer Institut, Switzerland."

%       names of any of its employees or laboratories, in any advertising, promotional or sales material without prior written consent obtained from LICENSOR in each case.
% 7.	Ownership of all rights, including copyright in the PROGRAM and in any material associated therewith, shall at all times remain with LICENSOR, and LICENSEE 
%       agrees to preserve same. LICENSEE agrees not to use any portion of the PROGRAM or of any IMPROVEMENTS in any machine-readable form outside the PROGRAM, nor to 
%       make any copies except for its internal use, without prior written consent of LICENSOR. LICENSEE agrees to place the following copyright notice on any such copies:

% 8.	The LICENSE shall not be construed to confer any rights upon LICENSEE by implication or otherwise except as specifically set forth herein.
% 9.	DISCLAIMER: LICENSEE shall be aware that Phase Focus Limited of Sheffield, UK has an international portfolio of patents and pending applications which relate 
%       to ptychography and that the PROGRAM may be capable of being used in circumstances which may fall within the claims of one or more of the Phase Focus patents, 
%       in particular of patent with international application number PCT/GB2005/001464. The LICENSOR explicitly declares not to indemnify the users of the software 
%       in case Phase Focus or any other third party will open a legal action against the LICENSEE due to the use of the program.
% 10.	This Agreement shall be governed by the material laws of Switzerland and any dispute arising out of this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM shall be brought before 
%       the courts of Zürich, Switzerland.
