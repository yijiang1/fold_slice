% function mark = energy2mark(E,calib_file)
% After calibrating using beamline.mark_interpolation_setup you can use
% this function to input a desired energy and a linear interpolation will
% determine and give you the mark
%   Inputs
%  E            Array of energies in keV
%  calib_file   Name of the file with the calibration
%
%   Outputs
%  mark         Array of marks corresponding to input energies
